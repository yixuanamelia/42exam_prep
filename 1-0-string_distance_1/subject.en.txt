Complete the following string_distance.c file given with this assignment. This
file is a program who should take two arguments that are strings and try to 
calculate the distance between those two.

The distance between two strings is a metric for measuring the difference 
between two sequences ( repetitions, placement, alignment... ). A distance is 
always measured between 0 and 1 ( use float to compute this kind of numbers ).
The closer the words are, the higher the value.

For example:
- ‘rome’ and ‘pope’ will have a higher distance value than ‘rome‘ and ‘chair’
- ‘hair’ and ‘fair’ will have a higher distance value than ‘hair‘ and ‘tear’
- ‘notebook’ and ‘playbook’ will have a higher distance value than ‘notebook‘ and ‘elephant’

The program should return a float greater than 0 depending on the distance 
between the two strings and outputs 0 if the distance is the same.

A example of pseudo algorithm to perform the task may look like:

Let len1, len2 the length of string1 and string2;
Let total_distance=0;
For each c1 and c2, characters of string1 and string2 in the same position:
    1) Find a way to score the distance between the two characters (you may think of  different ways to do this).
    2) Add this value to the total distance.
return total_distance;

You can build your own if you want.
